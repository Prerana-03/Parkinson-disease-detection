    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Background:\n",
    "- Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement control. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective management and intervention. Machine learning techniques, such as logistic regression, offer a promising approach to diagnosing Parkinson's disease based on relevant clinical features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective:\n",
    "- The goal of this project is to implement logistic regression to develop a diagnostic model for Parkinson's disease. Leveraging a dataset containing clinical measurements and relevant features, the model will learn to distinguish between patients with Parkinson's disease and those without.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset:\n",
    "- The dataset consists of clinical measurements collected from individuals, including features related to voice and motor control. Each example in the dataset is labeled with the binary outcome: whether the individual has been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (1) or not (0)."
